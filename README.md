# auth0wrap
Usernames, passwords, refresh tokens - oh my!

Rolling your own authentication is hard. And it's risky! Unless you're a
megacorp with a dedicated security team, you're better off using a free AuthN/Z
provider for managing your users' credentials. 

This library will help you do just that using a Social Identity Provider (IdP)
like Google, Facebook, or Twitter. It's a wrapper around the Auth0 Social API, which
is a wrapper around the OAuth2 protocol. It's a wrapper around a wrapper around
a protocol. It's turtles all the way down.

Let Auth0 handle your OAuth user flow and storing those sweet, sweet credentials.
You just focus on building your app.
